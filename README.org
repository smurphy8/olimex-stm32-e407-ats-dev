* Nixified STM32-base F4 Project for the olimex STM32-E407 board
The [[https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407.pdf][OlimexSTM32-E407]] is a very nice board for development. As it has a 
working phy and ethernet setup. The breakouts are very nice as well and 
it will plug right in and work with the standard st-link/v2 controller. 


** Building your code 
The chip is the STM32F401

+ =make=  Builds Code
+ =make flash=  Downloads to connected and configured STLINK V2 device
+ =make clean=  Cleans Code



** Downloading your code to st
*** Connections   
This example assumes you are using an stlink compatable programmer.
[[https://stm32-base.org/guides/connecting-your-debugger][This guide shows how to properly connect the debugger]]
My Connection:
[[./img/ST-LINK_V2_Official_Header.png]]

when you have everything connected right you should be able to 
=ls /dev= 
and see =stlinkv2_5= or something similar.


*** nix-shell
Going into the nix shell using =nix-shell= properly 
sets up the make file configuration including downloading the F4 
project enviornment and making the linked variables. 
It also brings the st-link utilities into scope.

From here, you can you can run:
#+begin_example using st link
[nix-shell:~/hardware/lumberjack-io/stm32-first-proj]$ st-util -p 4500
st-util 1.5.1
2021-07-29T18:44:51 INFO usb.c: -- exit_dfu_mode
2021-07-29T18:44:51 INFO common.c: Loading device parameters....
2021-07-29T18:44:51 INFO common.c: Device connected is: F4 device, id 0x10076413
2021-07-29T18:44:51 INFO common.c: SRAM size: 0x30000 bytes (192 KiB), Flash: 0x401c00 bytes (4103 KiB) in pages of 16384 bytes

#+end_example

This sets up a gdb enviornment so that once you =make= your files you can load the elf.
[[https://www.mankier.com/1/st-util][useful st-util tutorial]]
#+begin_example
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:4500
Remote debugging using localhost:4500

(gdb) load firmware.elf
#+end_example

replace =firmware.elf=  with your file



** STM32-base F4 template

This is a project template for using the STM32-base project with a STM32F4 series device. See the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base) for more information on how to get started with this template.

**Note:** If you want to report an issue for this template, please report it on the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base).


or to just flash it onto the device you can run 
=make flash=


* Last working st-link
I use the stlink v 7 in the shell but I still do an install of stlink native to Ubuntu.
This fixes some of the /dev things that you need to work properly to flash items.
